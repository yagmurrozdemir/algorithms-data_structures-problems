In this exercise, you will be asked for implementing a basic matrix class with some operations in it.

Your matrix class will have the following private members:

1) int n: This n value will determine your matrix dimensions as (nxn)

2) int** matrix: This will be your matrix itself. It's dimensions are determined by int n member.

With this question, you will be familiar with the classes, class member get/set functions, operator overloading and class general purpose functions subjects.
